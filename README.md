### 1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze the influence of non-enterprise-affiliated contributors
to enterprise-driven OSS projects.
Particularly we aim to investigate the following project characteristics from contributors' perspective.

- commit frequency
- contribution size (LOC, files)
- activity distribution

### 2. Methodology


### 3. Preliminary Findings


### 4. Challenges
One of the challenges that we faced early on was trying to deduplicate the dataset using the p2P map. We found it difficult to obtain information on whether a project is a forked or cloned one or not. We propose that a more user-friendly output could have solved that issue.

### 5. Future Work
