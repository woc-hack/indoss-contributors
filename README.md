# Contributor analysis in enterprise-driven OSS projects

The purpose of this project is to analyze the influence of non-enterprise-affiliated contributors
to enterprise-driven OSS projects.
Particularly we aim to investigate the following project characteristics from contributors' perspective.

- commit frequency
- contribution size (LOC, files)
- activity distribution

This work is based on the following datasets.

- [A Dataset of Enterprise-Driven Open Source Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03927), MSR 2020
- [World Of Code: Complete, Curated, Cross-referenced, and Current Collection of Open Source Version Control Data](https://worldofcode.org/)

The project team consists of the following members
from the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.aueb.gr/en/international), Greece.
